# Introduction {#intro}

My name is Gabe Benitez and I am a Water Resources Engineer-in-Training (EIT) with a goal of developing a living document to share the workflows I use on engineering projects. This guide also serves as a record of lessons learned and opportunities for improvement to help refine my processes over time.

## About me
![](images/gabe-hcp1-color.jpg){width=400px style="margin-bottom: 1em;"}

I grew up in Anoka, Minnesota, and earned my Bachelor of Science in Environmental Sciences, Policy, and Management with a minor in Soil Science from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. My undergraduate studies focused on landscape-scale processes, particularly pedogenesis—the formation and development of soils. During this time, I was an active member and captain of the University of Minnesota Soil Judging Team from 2017 to 2020. More information about the team can be found at https://umnsoilsteam.blogspot.com/
.

After completing my undergraduate degree, I pursued my goal of becoming an engineer at Utah State University, where I earned a Master of Science in Civil and Environmental Engineering. While at the Utah Water Research Laboratory (https://uwrl.usu.edu/
), I conducted research under Dr. Colin Phillips focused on sediment dynamics in fluvial systems and how these processes shape river morphology using high-resolution LiDAR. My thesis can be found at https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/etd2023/444/
.

Following my master’s degree, I took a break from computer-based research and joined the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) as a Soil Scientist, conducting initial soil mapping across the great state of Alaska. This work brought me to many incredible places, including the Copper River Basin, Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Arctic Coastal Plain, and many locations in between. After three rewarding years with the federal government, a change in administration prompted me to transition out of the public sector.

Today, I am continuing my professional journey as an engineer—bringing together my background in earth sciences and engineering to solve complex environmental and infrastructure challenges.
