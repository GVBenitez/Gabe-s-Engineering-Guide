This guide also serves as a record of lessons learned and opportunities for improvement to help refine my processes over time. 1.1 About me I grew up in Anoka, Minnesota, and earned my Bachelor of Science in Environmental Sciences, Policy, and Management with a minor in Soil Science from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. My undergraduate studies focused on landscape-scale processes, particularly pedogenesis—the formation and development of soils. During this time, I was an active member and captain of the University of Minnesota Soil Judging Team from 2017 to 2020. More information about the team can be found at https://umnsoilsteam.blogspot.com/ . After completing my undergraduate degree, I pursued my goal of becoming an engineer at Utah State University, where I earned a Master of Science in Civil and Environmental Engineering. While at the Utah Water Research Laboratory (https://uwrl.usu.edu/ ), I conducted research under Dr. Colin Phillips focused on sediment dynamics in fluvial systems and how these processes shape river morphology using high-resolution LiDAR. My thesis can be found at https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/etd2023/444/ . Following my master’s degree, I took a break from computer-based research and joined the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) as a Soil Scientist, conducting initial soil mapping across the great state of Alaska. This work brought me to many incredible places, including the Copper River Basin, Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Arctic Coastal Plain, and many locations in between. After three rewarding years with the federal government, a change in administration prompted me to transition out of the public sector. Today, I am continuing my professional journey as an engineer—bringing together my background in earth sciences and engineering to solve complex environmental and infrastructure challenges. 1.2 Disclaimer The information and workflows in this book are provided for general educational and informational purposes only.
